# A Verifiable and Low-Latency Cross-Chain IoT Service Query Scheme with Collaborative Indexing
 Internet of Things (IoT) devices are widespread and ubiquitously used to collect data. Given the sensitivity of this data, privacy and security concerns demand for safe handling of such data. Blockchain ensures decentralization and data security through immutable service records and tamper-proof query execution. The single-chain architecture is constrained in supporting multi-agency IoT environments for isolated data structures and interoperability bottlenecks. On the other hand, cross-chain service queries enable secure interoperability and dynamic resource integration across heterogeneous blockchain systems but are amenable to privacy breaches, query latency, and consistency in multi-chain environments. To address all of these challenges, we propose a verifiable and low-latency cross-chain IoT service query scheme by constructing a collaborative indexing approach.
To encapsulate IoT service attributes, we design a service metadata model based on partial encryption, allowing service providers to upload services in metadata form. To achieve fine-grained metadata queries, the collaborative indexing mechanism filters irrelevant chains through a global index to narrow the query scope and then utilizes localized sub-indexes, optimizing search efficiency. Finally, we construct data structures based on fingerprint verification to ensure consistency between the query layer and blockchain data.
