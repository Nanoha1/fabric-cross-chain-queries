# fabric-cross-chain-queries
 The emergence of IoT services necessitates secure and efficient query mechanisms for dynamic service discovery and interaction. Existing blockchain solutions lack interoperability in multi-chain environments, limiting their applicability in complex IoT scenarios. Cross-chain service queries enable the integration of data resources from different blockchain systems, thereby enhancing the scalability of IoT ecosystems. However, such queries encounter three challenges: achieving efficient query amid heterogeneous data formats, safeguarding sensitive information, and maintaining consistent query results across distributed networks. This paper proposes PCSQ, a verifiable and privacy-preserving collaborative indexing approach for cross-chain IoT service queries. PCSQ aims to ensure efficiency, data privacy, and query result consistency in distributed IoT environments.  PCSQ introduces a collaborative indexing mechanism that constructs a service metadata model using partial homomorphic encryption, encapsulating IoT service information while preserving its privacy. Metadata is securely stored on the blockchain and periodically transformed into a unified, queryable format through a distributed indexing layer. The mechanism employs a global index to narrow the query space and a local indexes for fine-grained metadata organization, significantly improving query efficiency. The approach leverages lightweight hash-based fingerprint verification via smart contracts to maintain consistency between the query layer and the blockchain.
